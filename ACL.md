# Access Control (ACL)

## What is **Role Based Access Control (RBAC)** and why do we care?
 *idea* of **assigning system access to users based ** on their role in an organization. It's important to remember that not every employee needs a starring role.

 roles based on common job responsibilities and system access needs

 ### RBAC implementation 
 1. Inventory your systems

 2. Analyze your workforce and create roles

 3. Assign people to roles

 4. Never make one-off changes

5. Audit

# Design

When defining an RBAC model, the following conventions are useful:


S = Subject = A person or automated agent

R = Role = Job function or title which defines an authority level

P = Permissions = An approval of a mode of access to a resource

SE = Session = A mapping involving S, R and/or P

SA = Subject Assignment

PA = Permission Assignment

RH = Partially ordered Role Hierarchy. RH can also be written: ≥ (The notation: x ≥ y means that x inherits the permissions of y.)
