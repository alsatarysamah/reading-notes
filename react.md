`# React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React is used to build single-page applications.

React allows us to create reusable UI components.

These are some advantages of the Component Driven Development in React:

 Reusability: In Component Driven Development, 

 the development process is in place, components once created can be easily used across as many modules as needed.

# React Components

Components are like functions that return HTML elements.

 # JSX

 What is JSX? JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
 
  JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

JSX converts HTML tags into react elements

  
**example :**

  ``` js
  import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

const myFirstElement = <h1>Hello React!</h1>

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(myFirstElement);
  ```
