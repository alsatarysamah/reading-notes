# sql vs nosql

SQL ( structured query language ) 

nosql(not only sql)

1-SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational.

2-SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.

3-SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

3-SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.

4-SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

5-SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb

*For complex queries :sql is good

*For the type of data to be stored:NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage

*For scalability:sql is vertically scalable but nosql is horizontally scalable. 

*For support:sql has Excellent support from its vendor
